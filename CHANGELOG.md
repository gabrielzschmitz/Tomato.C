## [1.0.3] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **Session duration now includes short and long breaks** — `HistSessionsForDay`
  and `GetPomodoroHistoryDay` compute duration via the pomodoro formula
  (`cycles × work + (cycles−1) × short + long`) instead of using
  `current_step_time` or `total_elapsed`, giving accurate planned session
  length.
- **History overview (`-h`) work time now equals full session time** —
  `createPomodoroHistoryStats` counts total session duration (work + pauses)
  instead of work-only, matching the per-day display.
- **TUI history statistics dialog no longer overcounts sessions and focus
  time** — `CreateHistoryStatsDialog` deduplicates by `session_index` and uses
  the formula for focus time instead of summing `current_step_time / 60` across
  every per-minute record (which inflated counts by 145× per session).
- **Day history dialog end time now reflects real recorded end** —
  `HistSessionsForDay` returns end times via
  `session_start_time + total_elapsed` (the actual wall-clock end), not
  `start_time + formula_duration`, so skipped sessions display the correct
  end time.
- **`localtime_r` replaces non-reentrant `localtime`** in history display
  functions to avoid shared-data races.

### Changed

- **`HistSessionsForDay` signature** — New `time_t* endTimes` parameter for
  returning real session end times; callers may pass `NULL`.
- **Row numbering in history dialogs** — Sessions are now numbered sequentially
  per day (1, 2, 3…) instead of showing the global `session_index`.

### Added

- **Comprehensive unit tests for `HistSessionsForDay`** — 8 new tests covering
  skipped sessions (endTime == startTime), multi-record deduplication,
  formula-based duration, end-time from `total_elapsed`, uncompleted sessions
  (duration 0), same-day multiple sessions, and day filtering.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **Default static frame support** — Optional `/Df` suffix on sprite header
  lines selects a static frame for non-animated rendering. All `.asc` files
  updated with appropriate default frames per scene.

- **Multi-format icon switching** — All three icon types (nerd-icons, emojis,
  ascii) are parsed at init into a 2D array
  `icon_animations[MAX_ICON_TYPES][MAX_ANIMATIONS]`, with `app->animations` as
  a pointer to the active set. Icon changes in the preferences menu now take
  effect immediately via LEFT/RIGHT/SPACE, not just after closing the sub-dialog.

### Fixed

- **Notes scene not rendering when `!ANIMATIONS`** — `renderNotesScene` was
  skipped in the non-animated branch; notes page indicator is now rendered with
  an animation reference.
- **Page transitions stuck when `!ANIMATIONS`** — `UpdateNotes` early-returned
  before completing page transitions, leaving `transitioning` permanently set.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- **Config paths broken when running outside the project directory** —
  Notification `audio_path` and noise `sound_path` values read from TOML
  config files were stored as dangling pointers after `toml_free()`
  invalidated the parser's string table, causing `InitApp()` to read freed
  memory and fail with `ErrorCode 8`.  Fixed by `strdup`'ing (via
  `expandDatadir`) every path read from TOML before the parser is freed.

### Added

- **`$DATADIR` token expansion for configuration paths** — TOML config
  values for `audio_path`, `sound_path`, and logging file paths now
  support the `$DATADIR` token, which is expanded at load time to the
  compile-time `DATADIR` path (e.g. `/usr/local/share/tomato`).  This
  makes configuration files portable regardless of installation prefix
  or working directory.

### Changed

- **`sample_config.toml`** — All hardcoded `audio_path` and `sound_path`
  values replaced with `$DATADIR/sounds/...` tokens, preventing path
  breakage when the sample config is used as a user config.
